<p><b>Chennai Super Kings (CSK)</b> is a professional cricket franchise based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, that competes in the Indian Premier League.Founded in 2008, the team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The team is owned by India Cements through its Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited holding company.They have won a record five IPL titles (shared with Mumbai Indians), appeared in a record 10 finals and have qualified for the playoff stages 12 times out of the 14 seasons they have played, more than any other team.In January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn sports enterprise.</p>The CSK team is known for its consistent performance, having reached the IPL playoffs in all but one season they have played in. The team's success can be attributed to the leadership of their captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who is regarded as one of the greatest captains in the history of Indian cricket.</p>

<h2 align="center">History of Super Kings</h2>

<p>In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The Chennai franchise was sold to the India Cements for $91 million, making it the fourth most expensive team in the league behind Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.India Cements acquired the rights to the franchise for 10 years. Former ICC Chairman N. Srinivasan was the de facto owner of the Chennai Super Kings, by means of his position as the vice-chairman and managing director of India Cements Ltd. The franchisee was transferred to a separate entity named Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd., after the Supreme Court of India struck down the controversial amendment to the BCCI constitution's clause 6.2.4 that allowed board officials to have a commercial interest in the IPL and the Champions League Twenty20 on 22 January 2015.</p>
